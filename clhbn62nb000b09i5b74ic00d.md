Follow the best practices outlined in [gitâ€™s documentation](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?id=HEAD#n139) for your commits

* Subject line: capitalized; &lt;50 chars; w/o a full-stop;
    
* Messages should be meaningful, in the present tense and with an imperative tone reading as instructions
    
* Have complete, [atomic commits](https://dev.to/samuelfaure/how-atomic-git-commits-dramatically-increased-my-productivity-and-will-increase-yours-too-4a84) that logically separate the changes

I came across this great article on [How to tell great stories](https://www.julian.com/blog/storytelling) by [https://x.com/julian](https://x.com/julian). I encourage you to read it. The following are the main take aways (#cliffsnotes):

* Be prepared, writing it out if necessary
    
* Don’t memorize which makes you talk at people rather than to them
    
* Add hooks to make people question, drawing them in
    
* Dilate time dragging out answers using vocal rhythm (speed; volume; enthusiasm; staccato & rhyme)
    
* Genuinely “blow your own mind” telling it enthusiastically with confidence and joy
    
* Stretch the narrative about meaningful stories which you relive it as you tell ittically

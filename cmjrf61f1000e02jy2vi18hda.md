[Tal Ben-Shahar's](https://x.com/TalBenShahar) [video](https://youtu.be/q6yPcEk93nk?si=bH6XPjY0rClzbbBU) talking about anti fragility is definitely worth the watch. Here’s what I learned.

Type 1 resilience is elastic. Under stress you bend and can return to your previous state. A non plastic deformation of a spring. Type 2 resilience is growth under pressure where you become stronger. It’s weight training at the gym. This is anti-fragility.

Everyone know’s what [P-T-S-D](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967) is. However P-T-Growth is where you actually grow under pressure. This happens when you ‘Learn to fail or fail to learn’. You deliberately learn from your failures.

Happiness is a spectrum. It’s not binary. Some days are better than others which you’ve to push through.

Spiritual . Physical . Intellectual . Relationship . Emotional - (SPIRE) are the 5 dimensions of well being who’s tenets are the quality of our relationships tied in with gratitude and growth.
